<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This assignment is inspired by the Newsweek-Bulletin unemployment
  survey conducted in 1999, that showed the real unemployment rate was
  substantially higher than the official one.  Questionnaire design is
  not something to be taken lightly if the results are important.  For
  anyone designing a real survey, then the
  <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/d3310114.nsf/home/Basic+Survey+Design+-+Questionnaire+Design">
  guidelines provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
  </a> should be taken seriously.
</p> <p>
But the real purpose of this assignment, of course, is to gain programming skills.  
This assignment will strengthen and test your programming skills in the
following areas:-
</p><ul>
  <li>Writing Functions</li>
  <li>Input Validation</li>
  <li>String Handling</li>
  <li>Dealing with anomalous data</li>
  <li>Creating and using an array of objects</li>
  <li>Counting data</li>
  <li>Summation of data</li>
  <li>Minimum and Maximum</li>
  <li>Writing a HTML directly to a web page</li>
</ul>
<p></p> <p>
A real online survey web page would need to send its data to
a web server which, in turn, would store the data in a database.
But web servers and databases are beyond the scope of this course, and we
will store the collected data locally in an array of objects, before
displaying the results in a web page.
</p> <p>
In Assignment 1, we did no validation of our collected data.  We just
assumed that the user entered it correctly.  Like programs in real life,
Assignment 2 requires full validation of the input data.
</p> <p>
The functions you developed in the workshop for Module 7
(conducted in Week 6) will prove useful in this assignment.  You should
use them where possible.  Make sure you finish all the workshop
exercises from the workshop in Week 6 before attempting this assignment.
</p>
<h2 id="task">Your Task</h2>
  <p> 
  Let us imagine that a <b>human facilitator</b>
  is equipped with a laptop, and is surveying
  people.  The facilitator will use your program to:-
  </p><ol>
    <li> Enter the collected data.
    </li><li> Perform some calculations.
    </li><li> Display some results, including a summary of collected data in the form of a HTML table.
  </li></ol>
  <p></p>
  <img src="./ass2 contents_files/flowChart1.png" width="300"><br>
  <i> Diagram 1: The Three Parts of your Code.  </i> 
  <p> 
    Your program has 3 phases, as shown in the diagram above:-
    </p><ol> 
      <li> An input phase that collects the raw data.
      </li><li> A calculation phase, that begins when the input phase is
            finished.
      </li><li> A display phase that begins when the calculation phase is
            finished.  It displays calculated data as well as raw data
            in the form of a HTML table.
    </li></ol> 
  Please dont allow these phases of your code to bleed into each other.
  The input phase should do input only.  The calculation phase should
  perform intermediate calculations only.  The display phase should 
  display calculated data only.
  <p></p> 
 <p> <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/pluginfile.php/3219086/mod_resource/content/4/ass2.html?embed=1#top">Top</a></p>

  <h3 id="input"> The Input Phase </h3> 
    <img src="./ass2 contents_files/flowChart2.png" width="300"><br>
    <i> Diagram 2: The Input Phase.  </i> 
  <p> 
    Your program must allow the facilitator to keep entering the detail for
    another person until the facilitator no longer wishes to.
      How you achieve that is up to you, but it must be easy to use and
      you need to make sure the user knows what to do.  
</p> <p> 
      You must perform interactive input by using the <tt>prompt()</tt> function
        <i> (and possibly the confirm() function).  </i>
</p>
  <h4 id="input"> The Question Structure </h4> 
    <img src="./ass2 contents_files/questStruct1.png" width="150"><br>
    <i> Diagram 3: The Question Structure.  </i> 
<p>
    For each person that the facilitator chooses to enter, you need to get the
    following from the user:-
    </p><div style="margin-left:1cm;">
      <dl> 
        <dt> 1) The surname.
          </dt><dd> <i>(suggestion: .sName)</i> The persons surname cannot be empty.
        </dd><dt> 2) The given name.
          </dt><dd> <i>(suggestion: .fName)</i> The given name cannot be empty.
        </dd><dt> 3) The biological gender.
          </dt><dd> <i>(suggestion:</i> .gender) The gender must either be "male" or "female".  (You can
              make this "M" or "F" if you prefer.)
        </dd><dt> 4) The age in years.
          </dt><dd> <i>(suggestion: .ageYrs)</i> The age in years must be an integer in the range 15 to 100.
        </dd><dt> 5) The post code.
          </dt><dd> <i>(suggestion: .pCode)</i> The post code must consist of 4 digits.
        </dd><dt> 6) Employment Status 
          </dt><dd> <i>(suggestion: .emplyStat)</i> The employment status
              must either be the word "employed" or the word "unemployed".  
      </dd></dl> 
    </div>
<p></p> <p>
  The facilitator (or your marker) should require no training prior to
  using your program.  Make it clear to the facilitator what input would
  be valid.  Keep it simple.
</p> <p>
  E.G. "What color is your car? Enter
  either the string "black" or the string "white"?
</p> <p>
  E.G.  If you make it so that entering an empty string for a surname 
  is what terminates the input loop, then make sure that is obvious
  to the user.
</p> <p>
  You should use the method
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/Trim">trim()</a>
  to remove leading or trailing spaces from user input.
</p> <p>

 <h3 id="calculation"> The Calculation Phase </h3> 
The calculation phase begins when the input stage is finished, and the
display phase happens when the calculations have been performed.  Your
program must calculate the following collective data:-
  <ol> 
    <li> Unemployment rate.  Store it
          as a fraction.  This is a floating point value.
    </li><li> Average age in years for unemployed men.  This is a floating
    point value.
    </li><li> Average age in years for unemployed women.  This is a floating
    point value.
  </li></ol> 
 <p> <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/pluginfile.php/3219086/mod_resource/content/4/ass2.html?embed=1#top">Top</a></p>

 <h3 id="display"> The Display Phase </h3> 
 <p>
 Your output will be written to the document using document.write() or
 document.writeln().  The use of alert() is not
 acceptable, and any occurrences of console.log() will be assumed to be
 debugging.
 </p> <p>
  If your dataset is the empty set, then this must be stated.
 </p> <p>
 Otherwise, your program must state the collective calculated data,
 followed by a HTML table with all person's details, complete with
 headings, one person per table row.

<h2 id="Submission"> Assignment Submission </h2>
 You need to submit two files:-
 <ol> 
 <li>  You need to submit a plain text HTML file with a file extension
       of ".html".  Your marker will
       inspect the HTML, and test your code with the Firefox web browser.
 </li><li>  
  <p> The second file is (called the pcheck) is for plagiarism detection using Turnitin.  Copy
       and paste the content of your HTML document into a word processing
       document.  The following formats are acceptable:-
 </p> 
   <ul> 
     <li>Libre Office Write (.odt)
     </li><li>Miscrosoft Word (.docx).  
   </li></ul> 
   <p>
    The marker will view your word processing file, but only to make sure
    it contains the same content as your HTML file, so please dont
    waste time formatting it to make it look pretty.
   </p> <p>
    Marks will be removed if your word processing file does not contain
    the same content as your HTML.
   </p>

<h2 id="suggestions"> Suggestions</h2>

 <h3 id="HowtoApproach"> How to approach this assignment</h3>
 <p> 
 The assignment asks much:-  Do not attempt to do it all at once.
 Implement it a bit at a time, testing as you go.   Dont be too ambitious.
  </p><ul>
    <li> Initially, do the input phase <b>without</b> validation, and
          using the <b>simplest</b> scheme.
    </li><li> Initially, do not attempt the challenges.
  </li></ul>
 <h4> Before you Start </h4> 
 <ul> 
  <li> Read the assignment specification.
  </li><li> Read it again taking notes.
  </li><li> If something is not clear, then ask in the forums.
 </li></ul> 
 <h4> Then </h4> 
 <ul> 
  <li> 
    While you have time, and you have not finished the assignment
    <ul> 
  <li> Implement something else. 
     </li><li> Test what you just implemented
  </li><li> While it does not work as expected:-
    <ul> 
     <li> Fix it.
     </li><li> Test it again.
    </li></ul> 
  </li><li> Save a copy of that which worked, so you can go back to it if
        your next effort proves to be a disaster.
    </li></ul> 
 </li></ul> 
 <p></p> 
 <p> <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/pluginfile.php/3219086/mod_resource/content/4/ass2.html?embed=1#top">Top</a></p>

 <h3 id="HowtoFinishInput"> How to know when the user has finished inputting</h3>
 The following are commonly used methods:-
 <ol> 
  <li> The program might explicitly ask whether the user wishes to enter
      data for another person.  E.g.:-
      <p> <tt> 
        while (confirm("Do you wish to enter data for another person"))<br>
        {
      </tt> </p> 
      <i> <small> 
        <ul>
          <li> Note marks lost for use of a string literal.
          </li><li> This is simple, so you should do it this way first.
        </li></ul>
      </small> </i> 
  </li><li> 
     <p> 
       The user may simply enter the surname name, and the user terminates
       the input by entering an agreed string (e.g.a blank string) for the
       surname of the person.
     </p> 
     <i> <small>(This may be a little harder)</small> </i> 
  </li> 
 </ol> 
 <p></p> 
 <p> <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/pluginfile.php/3219086/mod_resource/content/4/ass2.html?embed=1#top">Top</a></p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
  <p>
    The following are challenges.  They are meant to be challenging, and the
    marks here are definitely not "low hanging fruit", offering few
    marks for much work.  Even so, you cannot get a "high distinction"
    in the assignment without attempting at least one of them.
  </p> <p>
    It is recommended that you only attempt these if you have finished
    the non-challenge parts and are confident with your program thus
    far.  Don't forget to save a working copy of what works.
   </p>
   <h3 id="sortRecs"> Sort the Records </h3>
   <p>
    This challenge will give experience sorting an array of records and
    using a custom comparison function to achieve that.
   </p> <p>
    As part of the calculation phase, sort the records using the surname
    as a primary field, and the given name as a secondary field.  Your
    marker will be able to view the sorted records in the tabular output
    of your program.
   </p>
 <p> <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/pluginfile.php/3219086/mod_resource/content/4/ass2.html?embed=1#top">Top</a></p>

   <h3 id="dob"> Day of Birth </h3>
    <p>
      This challenge will give experience in extracting components from
      a string as well as extra validation experience.
    </p>
    In place of "years of age" you should request the date of birth.
    <ul>
      <li>
        The date of birth must be in the form "dd/mmm/yyyy", (e.g.
        "05/Nov/1978").
      </li><li> The date string must be fully validated:-
      <ol>
        <li>Split the string into its components:- 
          <ul>
            <li> Convert the day to a number.
            </li><li> Convert the month string to a month index.
            </li><li> Convert the year to a number.
          </li></ul>
        </li><li>Use the components in a constructor for a date object.
        </li><li>Use isNaN(date.getTime()) as a thorough validation for the date.
      </li></ol>
      </li><li> Store the date object, not a string.

    <i> Diagram 4: The Expanded Employment Status.  </i> 
 <p>
      The entry of the employment status given above is simplistic.
      This challenge introduces a more realistic determination of
      employment status.
   </p> <p>
      The entry of the employment status is to be expanded:-
    </p><ol>
      <li> There are two additional values for the employment status.
            Please implement and call a function to input the employment
            status as depicted in Diagram 4.
      </li><li> Your function should not use global variables.
      </li><li> Instead of just "employed" or "unemployed" your table will
          now show one of 4 possible employment status values as
          depicted.
      </li><li> Calculate and display both an unemployed rate and an under-employed rate.
    </li></ol>
