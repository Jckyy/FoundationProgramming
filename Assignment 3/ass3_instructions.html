		<h2 id="teamAss"> This is a Team Assignment </h2>
		<p>
			If you intend to become a software developer, then you will most
			likely become part of a team.  A highly skilled individual who cannot work with the team
      will likely be of no value to the team.
			For this reason, industry values teamwork skills highly, especially in
			software developers.  Teamwork is part of the Australian Computer
			Society accreditation that this course enjoys.  Teamwork is
      required for this course.
		</p> <p>
			You <b>must</b> form a team of 2 (<b>two</b>) people.  I recommend the
			use of the social forum to find your team partner.  There, you can
			introduce yourself, read the introductions of other students.
		</p> <p>
      You will be required to register your team a few weeks in advance
      of the assignment due date.
      Those who form a team of 1 person, will be still be marked
      on the entire project, and will forgo the marks associated with
      teamwork (approx 14% of the marks).
		</p> <p>
      Both team members will be awarded the same mark for this assignment.

		<ul>
			<li> One of the biggest challenges of this assignment is <b>TEAMWORK</b>:-  
				<ul>
					<li> Proposing ideas and accepting the ideas of others.
					</li><li> Documentation of agreements made so that all team members
                understand what was agreed.
          </li><li> Specification of parts of the project:
              <ul>
                <li> The underlying data structure.
                </li><li> Specifying interfaces in order to facilitate dividing the work. e.g. :-
                  <ul>
                    <li> function arguments and return values.
                    </li><li> The data structures, including the fields of compound variables.
                  </li></ul>
              </li></ul>
					</li><li> Mutual accountability:-

                </li><li> , <b>OR</b>
                       what is sometimes much harder - informing your
                       partner that you cannot deliver what was agreed,
                       leaving sufficient time for the team to do
                       something about it.
              </li></ul>
					</li><li> Working together:-
            <ul>
              <li> Giving assistance to your partner when he or she needs it
              </li><li> , <b>OR</b> what is sometimes much harder - seeking
                  assistance when you need it.
            </li></ul>

          </li><li> Consistency.
            <ul>

                    for all of the code.
              </li><li> Consistent appearance of the form elements of the
                    resulting web page.
            </li></ul>
				</li></ul>
      </li><li>
        Of course, your programming skills will also be tested in this
        assignment:- 
        <ul>
          <li> HTML
          </li><li> Interaction with HTML form input.
          </li><li> Performing Validation and doing something about it when
                user input does not validate.
          </li><li> Writing HTML to targeted sections of a web page.
          </li><li> Writing functions.

    <h2 id="task"> Your Team's Task</h2>
    <p>
      Your team is required to develop a prototype web application for
      a human facilitator to conduct a survey that attempts to find the
      real unemployment rate, i.e. a like Assignment 2 except that
      it will be enhanced by:-
      </p><ul>
        <li> Using a graphical user interface.
        </li><li> Provide full details for a given individual.
        </li><li> List the people belonging to various subsets of those surveyed.
        </li><li> Ordering those lists according to various criteria.
        </li><li> A test plan and test results are required.
      </li></ul>
    <p></p> <p>
      Normally such a program would communicate with a server which in
      turn, would store and retrieve that data
      from a database.  However, this course has not taught server
      side programming, so your prototype is limited to a single browser
      window, and cannot load or save.
    </p> <p>
      Your web page will display the following sections:-
      </p><dl>
        <dt>
          Input Person Details
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A section for inputting the name, useful demographic details,
          and employment status of people surveyed.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Results
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A section for displaying the percentages of people classified
          as "Not in the workforce", "Unemployed", "Underemployed", or
          "Employed".<br>
          It can do this for the entire surveyed population or a given
          demographic subset of the surveyed population.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Person Details
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A section that shows all of the inputted data for 
          an individual person, the entire surveyed population or a given
          demographic subset of the surveyed population.
        </dd>

    <h3 id="records"> Questionnaire  Records </h3>
    Each record includes the following fields:-
    <ul>
      <li> <b>fName</b>: Given name of the person surveyed.
         <p>
          This is required.  It is a non-empty string, even after you
          apply the trim() method.
         </p>
      </li><li> <b>sName</b>: surname of the person surveyed.
         <p>
          This is required.  It is a non-empty string, even after you
          apply the trim() method.
         </p>
      </li><li> <b>gender</b>: Indicates the biological gender of the person surveyed.
        <p>
          Could be a string, or perhaps a boolean (e.g. isMale).
          <i>(The possibility of any genders other than "male" or
          "female" should probably not be allowed.  You may include the
          possibility of other genders, in keeping with current trends,
          but please note that doing so will create extra work for you,
          because you must then follow it through when you perform
          selection and/or sorting).</i>
        </p> <p>
          Whatever you choose to do here, full validation will be
          required.
        </p>
      </li><li> <b>dob</b>: The date of birth of the person surveyed.
        <p>
          This is required.  It is entered as a string in the form
          "dd/mm/yyyy".  It will be fully verified and will be stored as a Date object.
        </p>
      </li><li> <b>pCode</b>: The residential post code of the person being
      surveyed.
        <p>
          This is required.  It must consist of 4 digits.
        </p>
      </li><li> <b>curStat</b>: The current employment status of the 
          person being surveyed.  It must be one of:- "none", "part", or
          "full".
      </li><li> <b>desired</b>: The desired employment status of the 
          person being surveyed.  It must be one of:- "none", "part", or
          "full".
    </li></ul>
    <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/pluginfile.php/3233145/mod_resource/content/10/ass3.html?embed=1#top">top</a>

    <h2 id="sections">Sections</h2>
    <h3 id="inRec"> The Input Customer Records section </h3>
    <p>
      The user fills out the fields in this section, and then
      presses the "enter" button to add the record.  On
      success the web application will add the record, and also blank out (remove text from) the
      fields in preparation for the next record entry.
    </p> <p>
      The web application validates all fields and won't permit an
      invalid record to be entered if any of the fields are
      invalid. 
    </p> <p>
      When the user presses the enter button, if there are invalid
      fields, then rather than accepting the record, the application must
      provide an error message, and visually indicate which field has an
      unacceptable value.  You might choose do the visual indication by calling
      highlightLabel(), which is provided with the template.  Of course
      there may be more than one invalid field, but multiple error
      messages can be overwhelming, and it may be better to
      tell the user about the first problem only.
    </p>
    <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/pluginfile.php/3233145/mod_resource/content/10/ass3.html?embed=1#top">top</a>

    <h3 id="results"> The Results section </h3>
    <p>
    In this section we can show the percentage who are in each of the
    following groups:-
    </p><ul>
      <li>"Not in Workforce"
      </li><li>"Unemployed"
      </li><li>"UnderEmployed"
      </li><li>"Employed"
    </li></ul>
    This data should be presented in a table as depicted in Figure 1.
    <p></p> <p>
      The user can also see the results for a subset of the sample data
      by using filter controls depicted in Figure 1.
      The subset can be defined in the following ways:-
      </p><ol>
        <li>The user can limit the subset to "male only" or to "female only".
        </li><li>
            The user can limit the subset to those people who are
            greater than or equal to a minimum number of years.  The use
            can indicate no minimum by leaving the minimum blank (which
            is the default). 
        </li><li>
            The user can limit the subset to those people who are
            less than or equal to a maximum number of years.  The use can
            indicate no maximum by leaving the maximum
            blank (which is the default). 
        </li><li>
            The user can limit the subset to a given post code.
        </li><li>
            The user can limit the subset to be the intersection of any
            combination of the above subsets.  For example, if the user
            wants to know the unemployment rate for female persons of
            age of 21 or over who live in Toowoomba, then the user would set
            the filters as follows:-
            <ul>
              <li>The "Gender" would be set to "female only".
              </li><li>The "Min Age" would be set to 21.
              </li><li>The "Max Age" would be left blank.
              </li><li>The "Post Code" would be 4350.
            </li></ul>
      </li></ol>
    <p></p> <p>
      The Results section should behave gracefully if the sample data set is
      empty or if the requested subset is empty.  A message that
      explains that the data set is empty should appear in place of the
      output table.
    </p> <p>
    Similarly, you should present a message rather than a table if the
    filter criteria are invalid, e.g. the min age is not an integer or
    it is greater than the max age.
    </p>

    <h3 id="details"> The Person Details section </h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of this section is to present the user with all fields
      of the raw
      data for each person selected as depicted in Figure 1.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Filtering
    </h4>
    <p>
      The user can also see the details for a subset of the sample data
      by using filter controls depicted in Figure 1.
      The subset can be restricted in all the ways that we can limit the
      subset for the results.  In addition, we can also filter on the
      given name or the surname of persons surveyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if we wish to confirm the details of Fred Bloggs,
      then the user would set the filters as follows:-
            </p><ul>
              <li>The "Given name" would be set to "Fred".
              </li><li>The "Surname" would be set to "Bloggs".
              </li><li>The "Gender" would be set to "male and female".
              </li><li>The "Min Age" would be left blank.
              </li><li>The "Max Age" would be left blank.
              </li><li>The "Post Code" would be left blank.
            </li></ul>
      
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The output table will be shown with headings, but no data if the
     selected data set is empty.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Sorting
    </h4>
    The user may order the person details by:-
    <ul>
      <li> name (surname as primary sort criteria)
      </li><li> name (given name as primary sort criteria)
      </li><li> date of birth
      </li><li> post code
      </li>
    </ul>
    <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/pluginfile.php/3233145/mod_resource/content/10/ass3.html?embed=1#top">top</a>

		<h2 id="alphaTesting"> Alpha Testing </h2>
		<h3 id="testPlan"> Test Plan </h3>
    <p> 
      Teams are required to prepare a test plan for each of the three
      sections of the application.  The test plan should consist of a
      series of tests.  Each test should have a description and a data
      set.
    </p> 
		<h4 id="testPlanInput"> Test Plan for Input Customer Records</h4>
    <p>
    The ordinary entry of data needs to be represented by at least 3
    tests with valid data.
    </p> <p>
        There should also be some tests with nearly valid data, but invalid
      data for one of the input fields.  While only one test is required
      for fields that are merely required to be present, you should be
      able to design tests with different flaws for fields with more
      rigorous validation criteria.
    </p> <p>
      For example, there should be several tests featuring valid and invalid
      post codes:-
      </p><ul> 
        <li> 1234
        </li><li> 9999
        </li><li> 1111
        </li><li> 1
        </li><li> aaaa
        </li><li> 123

      Notice that many of the above test cases represent a different way
      that a post code can be invalid.
    <p></p> <p>
      There are many ways that birth date could be wrong.  The format
      could be violated, e.g. "123/123/123".  Or the format could be
      good, but reference a date that did not actually exist, e.g.
      "29/02/1971".
    </p> 

		<h4 id="testPlanSS"> Test Plan for Results section</h4>
    <p>
      There needs to be tests for given data sets where we know what the
      resulting percentages in each category are.  The provided template
      comes with some test data which may be used here.
    </p> <p>
      You should test with various subsets of the data too, and see if
      you get the correct answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There needs to be tests for the various minimum and maximum
      age.  What happens when the minimum is greater than the maximum or
      minimum or maximum age is invalid?
    </p> 
    <p> 
      Test for graceful behaviour in the case of the empty set.
    </p> 

		<h4 id="testPlanSS"> Test Plan for Person Details</h4>
    <p>
        You would need to all the tests that you would for the Results
        section.  In addition you would need to test for:-
        </p><ul>
          <li> Someone that exists.
          </li><li> Someone that does not exist.
        </li></ul>
    <p></p> <p> 
      There needs to be a test for each of the ways that
      the user may choose to sort.

		<h3 id="testProc"> Testing Procedure </h3>
    <p> 
      You need to record who carried out the testing of each section,
      and it should not be the person who is responsible for the coding
      of the section
      <i> (This may be unavoidable when we pair program in teams of two) </i>.
    </p> <p>
      The tester needs to document the results of each test carried out.
    </p> 
    <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/pluginfile.php/3233145/mod_resource/content/10/ass3.html?embed=1#top">top</a>

		<h3 id="testReport"> Testing Report </h3>
    <p>
      Your documentation needs to have a testing report for each of the
      three sections.  It needs to include the test plan, as well as the
      name of the tester and the results of each test.

		<h2 id="teamwork"> Teamwork Report</h2>

		<h3 id="contribution">Project Contribution</h3>
    <p>
    A statement outlining the team member contributions to the project
    is required in the report.
    Note that there are tasks other than coding.  The test plan, the
    testing and writing reports also takes time and effort.

		<h2 id="submission">Assignment Submission</h2>
      The final submission will consist of three documents.
      <ol> 
        <li> <b>Your team's result</b>:  A single plain text HTML
              document will contain all of the html, code, and styles
              that will be tested by your marker.
 
        </li><li> <b>Your team's report</b>: A single report saved in .doc,
              .docx, or .odt format will contain your team's test plan,
              test report, meeting summary and your member contribution
              report.  
        </li><li> <b>The pCheck</b>
          <p> 
             This document in .docx, or .odt format will
             contain a copy of the contents of your HTML document.
             Please do not bother too much with the formatting, as its
             purpose is for Turnitin, rather than for human reading.
          </p><p> </p> 
             There will be a 20% penalty if this document is absent,
             deliberately obscured, uses images rather than text or if
             its text differs from the text of the HTML document.
          <p></p>

		<h2 id="challenges"> Challenges </h2>
    <p>
    Challenges generally require much
    effort for few marks.  It is not recommended that you attempt the
    challenges unless you have successfully completed the other tasks of the
    assignment.  Be sure to save a copy of your working assignment
    before attempting any challenges.
    </p>
    <h3> Post Code Ranges </h3>
    <p>
     Permit post code ranges for the person details section and the
     results section.  For example the string "3445-3449,4233" would
     indicate that the user wants to accept any post code greater or
     equal to "3445" and less than or equal to "3449" or the post code
     "4233". 
    </p><p>
    Your specification of post code ranges must consist of one or more
	post code ranges ranges separated by commas.
    </p><p>
    Each post code range must either be a 4 digit post code, or it must
	consist of two 4 digit post codes separated by a minus sign. In the latter
	case, the second post code must be numerically greater or equal to
	the first post code.
	</p>
